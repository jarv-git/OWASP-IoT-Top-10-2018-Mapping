      <td style="text-align:left">Adopt a standardized industry recognized risk management approach. Baseline
        security requirements should be established for developed or acquired IoT
        components to comply with applicable legal, statutory, and regulatory compliance
        obligations. Deviations from standard baseline configurations should be
        authorized following change management policies and procedures prior to
        deployment, provisioning, or use. Compliance with security baseline requirements
        should be reassessed based on business needs.
        <br />
        <br />&quot;Perform a risk assessment. Analyze sources, storage and transmissions
        of sensitive data across devices, gateways, applications, data stores,
        mobile applications, cloud services, fog computing services and network
        infrastructure. Analyze data classification mechanisms and data security
        capabilities to protect sensitive data from unauthorized use, access, loss,
        destruction, and falsification. Analyze the potential for trusted insiders
        to misuse their privileged access to data. Analyze data retention periods
        and end-of-life disposal requirements. Identify safety risks. Prioritize
        risks based on impact and likelihood. Decide on risk migitations for each
        risk - mitigate, defer or accept the risk.
        <br />Perform a risk assessment as follows:
        <br />&#x2022;Analyze potential risk if the security of each of the following
        components would be compromised: sources, storage and transmissions of
        sensitive data across devices, gateways, applications, data stores, mobile
        applications, cloud services, fog computing services and network infrastructure.
        <br
        />&#x2022;Analyze data classification mechanisms and data security capabilities
        in order to protect sensitive data from unauthorized use, access, loss,
        destruction or falsification.
        <br />&#x2022;Analyze the potential for trusted insiders to misuse their privileged
        access to data.
        <br />&#x2022;Analyze data retention periods and end-of-life disposal requirements.
        <br
        />&#x2022;Based on these analyses, identify your organization&#x2019;s safety
        risks. Prioritize these risks based on potential impact and likelihood
        of occurrence.
        <br />&#x2022;Choose and implement risk mitigations for each potential security
        threat: actively mitigate, defer or accept the risk.&quot;</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">Document an enterprise IoT cyber security policy. Require all IoT implementations
        to comply with this policy or apply for an exception. Your enterprise IoT
        cyber security policy should include, at minimum, encryption, monitoring,
        auditing, authentication and access control, as well as physical security
        controls that must be applied to each component of your IoT system. Monitor
        frequently to identify out-of-compliance implementations.
        <br />
        <br />Monitor and validate the update (patch/version) status of each IoT device
        in your inventory. Flag devices that are out of policy or are unreachable
        due to disconnection. If the issue cannot be resolved (connection and update)
        through the IoT system, then an email, call or personal visit may be required,
        depending on the criticality of update and device use.
        <br />
        <br />Monitor for duplicate or compromised IoT devices. Establish rules to identify
        devices authenticating with the same identity credentials, which may indicate
        a security compromise. Investigate and remediate issues upon detection.
        <br
        />
        <br />Document a minimum cryptographic policy for TLS, DTLS and other cryptographic
        protocols. The policy should define acceptable algorithms, key lengths

        revision of NIST SP 800-131A.
        <br />
        <br />Document password policies that define minimum complexity requirements
        for IoT system users, administrators and service accounts. Define aging
        requirements for passwords. Define lock-out policies for all components
        of the IoT system.
        <br />
        <br />Document a data security policy for the IoT system. Define the organizational
        data classification levels and map minimum data security requirements to
        those classification levels.
        <br />
        <br />Document an identity management policy for the IoT system. Define appropriate
        uses for symmetric keys, passwords and certificates. Restrict the provision
        of duplicate identity credentials (keys, certificates, passwords) to no
        more than one device, user or service.
        <br />
        <br />Document a device security management policy for the IoT system. Define
        the minimum frequency for performing updates to firmware and software.
        Define minimum safeguards against malicious code that could compromise
        IoT devices. Define minimum frequency for applying patches to third party
        libraries.</td>

        <br />Perform a privacy assessment of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that
        issues credentials to IoT devices and services. Analyze the potential for
        tracking of user locations and activities based on correlation to the issued
        PKI certificates. If determined that a privacy concern exists, implement

        can be used instead. When possible, update systems to require certificates
        for authentication instead of passwords.
        <br />
        <br />Authentication credentials can be bound to the specific application authorized
        to make use of those credentials when using IEEE 1609.2 certificates for
        IoT devices. If using IEEE 1609.2 certificates, designate an application-unique
        identifier and use within the IEEE 1609.2 SSP/PSID bits. Validate the SSP/PSID
        fields when making authorization decisions.
        <br />
        <br />Document all IoT device configuration files. Digitally sign those files
        and store them in a secure repository. Use these digitally signed files
        to restore devices. Validate the digital signature of the file after provisioning
        to the device.
        <br />
        <br />Restrict access to IoT device configuration files. Require pseudo access
        to modify configuration files on IoT devices.
        <br />
        <br />Log all changes to configuration files. Log all access attempts to modify
        configuration files. Monitor continuously and audit on a regular basis.

        <br />Minimize privileged operations that run as root and do not run network
        services (e.g., web servers) as root.
        <br />Implement IoT system role-based access control (RBAC). Include standard
        roles for users, services and devices (e.g. device, local user, system
        operator, auditor, application, gateway).
        <br />
        <br />Identify privileged operations within the IoT system. Establish elevated

        development lifecycle for all developed IoT devices and components (e.g.
        OpenSAMM).
        <br />
        <br />Select an IoT integration framework to standardize secure on-boarding,
        configuration management, asset management, discovery and secure connectivity
        across newly developed IoT devices.
        <br />
        <br />Enforce the concept of least privilege. Limit applications and services
        that run as root and require authentication for all access. Do not run
        network services (e.g. web servers) as root.
        <br />
        <br />Establish good password processes. Do not hardcode passwords into the
        device and do not provision duplicate identities or passwords across multiple
        devices. Require password changes on a regular basis.
        <br />
        <br />Establish responsible disclosure policies and procedures and implement
        feedback loops to update product backlogs when a security vulnerability
        is identified or reported. Work with independent testers that report vulnerabilities
        to ensure the vulnerability is closed.
        <br />Integrate chip-to-cloud capabilities that leverage microcontrollers (MCUs)
        with pre-provisioned cloud trust anchors to support more secure bootstrap
        and zero-touch provisioning of IoT devices. Use secure MCU hardware features
        to protect sensitive material and cryptographic primitives and to perform
        trusted bootloading by validating software prior to booting.
        <br />
        <br />Use cryptographic coprocessors to offload CPU-intensive cryptographic
        operations. Design IoT products with cryptographic agility to support updates
        to algorithms and key sizes as existing approaches become obsolete. Make
        use of well-tested cryptographic modules (ideally FIPS (140-2 <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf">https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf</a>)
        validated). Use good sources of entropy for random number generation associated
        with key material. Ensure cryptographic modules perform power-up tests
        to include cryptographic algorithm tests, software/firmware integrity tests,
        and critical function tests.
        <br />
        <br />Eliminate or lock-down unnecessary hardware features of IoT devices (e.g.
        un-needed radios or USB interfaces). Disable or password-restrict any test
        interfaces (JTAG, UART, GPIO).
        <br />
        <br />Apply tamper protection for security-critical components of the IoT device
        ranging from simple seals and/or locked covers to piezo-electric circuits
        depending on the threat environment.
        <br />
        <br />Select a device real-time operating system (RTOS) that provides enhanced
        security features, such as application sandboxing, secure boot, access
        controls, trusted execution environment, kernel separation, and a (minimized)
        microkernel.
        <br />
        <br />Do not store API keys and other credentials in public-facing source control
        systems (e.g. gitlab/github). Publish procedures for the secure handling
        of API keys. Do not hardcode API keys into firmware, mobile applications,
        or any client-based application. Monitor at least quarterly to verify that
        API keys and other credentials are not stored in public-facing source control
        systems.
        <br />
        <br />Integrate MCUs with hardware-based separation architectures for higher
        assurance requirements. Label and operate security sensitive applications
        to run in the trusted side of the hardware only. Implement limited command
        interfaces between the trusted and untrusted components of the MCU. Configure
        the device to perform attestation of software (measure the security state
        of the software) prior to entering into trusted modes and use controlled
        execution to prevent timing delays from revealing sensitive information.
        <br
        />
        <br />Implement tamper-response mechanisms such as zeroization of key material
        and other sensitive data when warranted by the threat landscape.
        <br />
        <br />Select a device RTOS that is certified for use in specific industries,
        such as air travel and other transportation systems, industrial control
        systems, medical devices.
        <br />Establish supply chain practices. For example, subscribe to security alerts
        from all third party components and frameworks. Review updates immediately
        for proposed deployment.
        <br />
        <br />Use static and dynamic analysis tools to validate the security of all
        third party libraries.
        <br />
        <br />Validate the authenticity and integrity of all third party libraries and
        software components within an IoT system.

      <td style="text-align:left">Establish secure key management processes for IoT systems that include,
        at a minimum, key generation; key derivation; key establishment/transport;
        key storage; key lifetimes; and key zeroization/destruction. Keys should
        be generated on devices whenever possible, assuming those devices have
        a sufficiently random source of entropy. Central key generation and distribution
        is acceptable if secure transport mechanisms are used to deliver key material
        (including out-of-band provisioning).
        <br />
        <br />Establish policy to ensure private keys are never shared across multiple
        devices or groups. Incorporate forward-secrecy whenever possible for key
        derivations (e.g. do not use static mechanisms). Keys should always be
        stored in a secure element (software or hardware) capable of restricting
        access to keys by unauthorized actors. Keys should be limited in lifetime
        when possible to no more than three years and ideally only one year. Use
        automated mechanisms for key updates (e.g. rotation or derivation).
        <br
        />
        <br />Establish a specialized key management user group to configure key management
        securely for your IoT devices and services.
        <br />
        <br />Establish a process for securely bootstrapping IoT devices onto your networks.
        Give preference to IoT devices capable of zero-touch provisioning, as these
        devices are pre-loaded with manufacturer credentials embedded in the hardware.
        Zero-touch provisioning requires a trusted, out-of-band process for loading
        serial numbers and public keys of devices to be provisioned. If zero-touch
        provisioning is unavailable, set up a trusted facility to register device
        serial numbers and preload identities/keys/certificates into the device
        prior to fielding on the network. In all cases, encrypt all account registration
        and update commands.
        <br />
        <br />Audit and identify devices that contain default passwords and change those
        passwords immediately upon deploying (preferably before connecting to a
        network). Identify devices that share passwords with other devices and
        change those passwords immediately. Identify devices that share remote
        access keys and update those devices immediately with unique credentials
        per device
        <br />
        <br />Whenever possible, given the amount of IoT devices that populate networks,
        it is preferable to use certificates instead of passwords for remote access
        of IoT devices. as passwords become difficult to manage as quantities of
        devices increase. If passwords are used to access IoT devices remotely,
        then update those passwords at least once a year. When possible, implement
        mechanisms to update those passwords automatically.
        <br />
        <br />Establish a process and acquire technology to manage the secure update
        of device certificates and trust anchors. Opt for automated update capabililities
        when possible. Restrict access for updating device trust anchors to authorized
        administrators.
        <br />
        <br />Establish certificate management policies. Define minimum requirements
        for validation of device identities (enrollment) prior to certificate provisioning.
        Device identify validation should be based on (a) in-person review, or
        (b) automated provisioning based on established key material (e.g. by manufacturer).
        <br
        />
        <br />Establish operational certificate lifetimes of no more than three years.
        Manufacturers may embed device identity certificates with no expiration,
        but these certificates should only be used to establish short-term operational
        certificates.
        <br />
        <br />Establish automated certificate processes to include renewing certificates.
        <br
        />
        <br />Establish a process for certificate revocation that includes required
        reporting channels, investigation methods, and authorities who can approve/disapprove
        placement on the revocation list.</td>
